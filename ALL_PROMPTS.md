## CURRENT ISSUES & FIXES NEEDED:

### Issue 1: Wardrobe Analysis Always Returns "Blue Cotton Tops"
**Root Cause:** OpenAI Vision API call is failing silently, falling back to default values
**Fix Needed:** 
1. Improve error logging to see actual API errors
2. Use better prompt (see above)
3. Check if OPENAI_API_KEY is valid

### Issue 2: Outfit Validation "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Root Cause:** JSON parsing error or missing score fields in API response
**Fix Needed:**
1. Better error handling
2. Validate JSON structure before accessing properties
3. Use improved prompt with explicit field requirements

### Issue 3: Chat Not Using New Onboarding Data
**Root Cause:** User context building doesn't include all new fields (style_inspiration, style_vibe, style_message)
**Fix Needed:** Update user_context building to include ALL onboarding fields

---

## DATA FLOW:

**Onboarding Data Collected:**
- name
- gender
